# Contribution guide

Maintaining a repository is a lot of work and it is only possible with the
input for its users. That's why we love to get your feedback and continuously
improve! We want to contibuting to this project as easy and transparent as
possible. That's why we ask all contributions to go through a GitHub workflow.

## Ask a question, report a bug, or suggest new features

Wether you wish to report a bug, discuss the current state of the code,
how to use it, or propose new features, the GitHub repository is the place to
start.

Go to 'Issues' in the repository's menu and use the search bar to look for your
issue/question, maybe the discussion already exists! if you don't find what
you are looking for, use the green button
['New Issue'](https://github.com/bio-raum/gabi/issues/new)
and describe your problem/question with as many details as possible.

### Bug reports

Solving Bugs is not always easy and usually requires to be able to precisely
understand what happened. Try to include the following in your report, so we
can solve the problems quickly:

- A quick summary and/or background
- The software versions
- A precise description of the problem (what did you do? What happened?)
- Join input data that reproduce the problem if possible
- Attach relevant log files to the issue

## Improving the documentation

Writting a documentation is a big task and we are gratefull for any help
to expand and improve it.

If you find a specific section of the documentaiton unclear, or would like to
see it in other languages, we would love to hear about it, or if you feel like
it, try suggesting modifications.
