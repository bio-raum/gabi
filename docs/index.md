# GABI

GABI (Genomic Analysis of Bacterial Isolates) is a [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) pipeline for the quality control, assembly and characterization
of bacterial isolates from short or long "next generation" sequencing reads.

It is designed to be easily installed and used, and work on a wide range of configuration.

*The full documentation is available from the [homepage](https://bio-raum.github.io/gabi)*

## Highlights

- ready-to-use reports
- automatic sample classification
- automatic handling of reference databases
- requires only Nextflow and a container/environment manager to run
- easy deployment on a variety of configuartions through containerization
