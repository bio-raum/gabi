**G**enomic **A**nalysis of **B**acterial **I**solates, or GABI for short, is a bioinformatic workflow to assemble bacterial genomes, annotate genes, detect antimicrobial resistance genes, perform serotyping for select taxa as well assign MLS types. GABI supports both (Illumina) short reads and ONT/Pacbio long reads. Hybrid assembly approaches are supported for ONT/Illumina data sets and require for different read types to carry the same sample ID for grouping. Please see our [documentation](docs/usage.md) for detailed information.  

If you are really impatient, check out our [quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) guide.

## Acknowledgements

We thank the developers of the [AQUAMIS](https://gitlab.com/bfr_bioinformatics/AQUAMIS) pipeline for making some of the building blocks on which GABI is based publically available - specifically the ConfindR database and validation data for <i>Campylobacter spp.</i> as well as the reference intervals for a broad range of bacteria to determine assembly status. In addition, we thank the [nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re/) community for developing the standards on which GABI is based.
